Contents:

- 4 data files each for 10 emissions species (SO2, NOx, BC, OC, NH3, NMVOC,  CO, CO2, CH4, N2O) including global emissions by sector, total emissions by country, emissions by CEDS sector and country, and emissions by country and CEDS "fuel". (Note that the CEDS "process" category contains some combustion emissions from the energy transformation sector.) 

- For a mapping of iso codes to country names see:
https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS/blob/master/input/mappings/Master_Country_List.csv

Note that country totals in these summary files do not include international shipping or aircraft emissions. International shipping and aircraft emissions are reported under the "global" iso.
